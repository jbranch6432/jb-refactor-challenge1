# Code Refactor Starter Code

Module 1 Challenge 1

This project is to increase user viewing and decrease disability obstacles for interacting with the website.

The website accessibility was improved by: 

	*including HTML semantics
 
	*CSS selector and properties consolidation 

	*incorporating CSS comments

I hope to continue improving accessibilty beyond the desktop design and provide accessibility for mobile version as well.
